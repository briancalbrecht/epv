One of my favorite things to read on blogs is a "quotation of the day/week/minute". Well this is the title for words of economic wisdom that I find interesting.

[![George Stigler](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/George_Stigler.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Stigler.jpg)


<blockquote>"Whether one is a conservative or a radical, a protectionist or a free trader, a cosmopolitan or a nationalist, a churchman or a heathen, it is useful to know the causes of economic phenomena." -George Stigler via [Thomas Sowell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell)'s important read, _Basic Economics._</blockquote>
