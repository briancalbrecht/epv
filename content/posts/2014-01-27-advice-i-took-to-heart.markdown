As I'm sitting here, reading _[Theory of Price](http://econpointofview.com/2013/09/25/stigler-chapter-1-introduction-to-economic-analysis/) _instead of doing my problem sets, I am reminded of advise from Deirdre McCloskey ([pg 489](http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/pdf/Article_315.pdf)) that I took to heart-


<blockquote>But if a world famous economist suggest casually in conversation that you might want to read, say _The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, _I want to see you buying it that very afternoon, skipping your econometrics homework, and going back to the professor with the book thoroughly read, asking her to discuss it with you.</blockquote>


The great part about the blogosphere is that world famous economists are always recommending stuff to read. The hard part about the blogosphere is that world famous economists are always recommending stuff to read. Sometimes they even discuss them with dumbies like me.

Or maybe this is just my excuse for skipping my econometrics homework...
