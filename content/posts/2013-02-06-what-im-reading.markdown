[![Cover of "The Myth of the Rational Market...](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B8R5z84mL._SL300_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Rational-Market-History-Delusion/dp/0060598999%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzem-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0060598999)



[The Myth of the Rational Market: Wall Street's Impossible Quest for Predictable Markets ](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4749235-the-myth-of-the-rational-market)by [Justin Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fox)- This is a review of the history of [efficient market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) theories and an introduction to some counter points raised in recent years. It is very accessible to non-economists and has got off to an interesting start. More will come later.





[![Israel Kirzner, Austrian School economist](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Israel_Kirzner.jpg)](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Israel_Kirzner.jpg)

[Competition and Entrepreneurship ](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1084282.Competition_and_Entrepreneurship)by [Israel Kirzner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Kirzner)- This is my second run though of Dr. Kirzner's famous work. At times, astonishingly convincing, at times a little more difficult to follow, it is always insightful. Whether his theory is complete is not for me to say, but he does add a nice dimension to disequilibrium to the microeconomic equilibrium analysis that dominated the time of Kirzner's writing. I hope to do either a full length review or a chapter by chapter analysis for my own records.








[![Cover of ](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R0qc-riHL._SL300_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Choose-Statement-Milton-Friedman/dp/0156334607%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzem-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0156334607)

[Free to Choose: A Personal Statement ](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97820.Free_to_Choose)by [Milton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) and [Rose Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Friedman)- Sometimes it is important to go back to the basics and appreciate the wonder of voluntary cooperation. Although markets are not perfect, the Friedman's lay out many examples illustrating the power of them. A great introduction to economic reasoning for the layman.
