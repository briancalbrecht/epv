It's that time of the year again where people are abuzz about who made the cut and who didn't. No. I'm not talking about the MLB playoffs. I'm talking about the Nobel Prize in Economics.

It's the time of the year where geeks like me get giddy with excitement. For a moment, an economist makes headlines. It's a fun time, the closest we come to the excitement of a sport.

Since this is my blog and I can do whatever I want, I thought I'd post my completely arbitrary predictions about who will win. Disclaimer: if you believe these predictions are based on any scientific procedure, I have an ocean front property in Arizona to sell you.

Prediction:



	
  * Robert Barro - "for his contribution to the theory of economic growth"


Wishes (and why):

	
  * Israel Kirzner - "for his contributions to the theory of entrepreneurship"

	
    * Because he's my favorite living economist. The opening of his book _Competition and Entrepreneurship _is the reason I became an economist. I can still remember reading it in the library. My blog is named after his first book. Need I say more about how I'm a fan of Kirzner?




	
  * AndreiShleifer and RobertVishny - "for their contributions to the study of corporate governance and finance"

	
    * Shleifer is one of the most creative economists in the last few decades. His work on regulation, behavioral economics, and law and economics is top notch.




	
  * Randall Wright andNobuhiroKiyotaki - "for their contributions to the theory of money."

	
    * Wright is teaching my monetary class next semester. I enjoy his work enough and would love to say I studied with a Nobel winner. I know it's stupid, but hey, why not cheer for the home team?





There we are. With the full backing of science, my prediction and hopefuls.

What do you guys think?

P.S. I don't care that the Economics Nobel isn't a "real" Nobel.
