As elaborated in a [earlier post](http://econpointofview.com/2013/09/24/mas-colell-chapter-1-preference-and-choice/), I am working through Mas-Colell to learn Samuelsonian microeconomics. As a foil, I am also studying price theory and [praxeology](http://mises.org/rothbard/praxeology.pdf) through [George Stigler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stigler)'s _Theory of Price _and [Murray Rothbard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard)'s [_Man, Economy, and State_](http://mises.org/Books/mespm.PDF), respectively. Through this, I hope to develop a more complete understanding of "microeconomics" than any book alone.


## Introduction to Economic Analysis


The logic elaborated by Stigler is easier for beginning economists and laymen. It is accessible from page one. Following [Lionel Robbins](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Robbins.html), Stigler's focuses on resource allocation1 and- you guessed it- the "determination of prices." Stigler needs a theory of the consumer and producer to carry this out, called "price theory." Most economists today would call it micro.

For Stigler, price theory makes statistical claims about the real world. He uses an example of searching for a car to show the power and simplicity of price theory. Economists theorize that a car buyer will keep searching for a better deal until the buyer believes the additional cost of searching outweighs the potential benefit of a lower price. This common sense argument is then translated into economics jargon as


<blockquote>To maximize his utility, the buyer searches for additional prices until the expected savings from the purchase equals the cost of visiting one more dealer.  Then he stops searching and buys from the dealer who quotes the lowest price he has encountered. (pg 2)</blockquote>


This example theory must be tested in two ways, logically and empirically. First, consider if the proposition is not true. That means the person will keep looking even when the anticipated gain is smaller than the assured lost of time and energy. While people may do this from time to time, consistent wasteful action cannot last. The theory is logically sound.

For the noneconomists, maximizing utility requires a lot of assumptions that are not necessarily true. [Logic is not enough](http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/). It must also be valid. Price theory requires empirical evidence. Fortunately, The quote above leads to testable hypotheses. People should search longer on goods with diverse prices across sellers. This is a testable hypothesis and when tested, generally it has been proven right. People spend more time shopping for homes or cars than eggs. This is why economists assume rationality. People _tend_ to act rationally and because of that price theory is a powerful tool for predicting behavior.

## Good Theory


Many theories exist, but an economist must sort the good from bad. For Stigler, a good theory requires two attributes. It is "more or less" true and applies to a "large" amount of cases. The difficulty arises because these two attributes are partly incompatible. It is easy to come of with theories that are true, such as stock prices fall on October 29th, 1929. This theory is true, but since it is so specific it does not aid prediction. It is also easy to come up with a theory that is general- car sales increase in odd-numbered years. While this theory is general and provides a prediction, it is not "more or less" true. This is the balancing act that price theory economists must do. For Stigler,  a good theory will "yield predictions better than those which can be reached with any alternative theory" (pg 7). Relative predictive power is the key.

Even though economists are notoriously bad at prediction, only a better theory can beat a worse theory. Predictions inside and outside of economics are not perfect. This is not sufficient to reject a theory. Man is fallen, so everywhere there is error. Instead, the price theorist must have a _better_ theory. Until he has better, he must use the best of the worst. If the best theory is to flip a coin, flip a coin.

Stigler contrasts good theories with theories that have no predictive power. These "theories" are just tautologies. For example, to say that a firm should equalize marginal cost and marginal revenue in order to maximize profits is a mathematical statement of a maximum. This "theory" does not help the economist predict what a real firm will do.

As I quoted in [another post](http://econpointofview.com/2013/09/12/well-put-my-friend-9/), developing a good theory is not an easy task.


<blockquote>The goal of the economist is not merely to train a new generation in his arcane mystery: it is to understand this economic world in which we live and the other ones which a thousand reformers of every description are imploring and haranguing us to adopt. This is an important and honorable goal.

It is not an easy goal, however, or one which is now or ever will be fully achieved. A modern economic system is of extraordinary complexity. Imagine a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, consisting of roughly 100 million parts. Some parts touch against, let us say, 1,000 other parts. (This is each family deals at one time or another with that many employers, banks, retail stores, domestic servants, and so on.) Other parts touch- let us be conservative- 50,000 other parts (firms that sell to retailers and buy from other firms and hire laborers and so on). It would be enough of a task to fit these 100 million pieces together, but the real difficulties have yet to be mentioned. The pieces change shape quite often- a family has twins; a firm does the next best things and invents a new product. The economist has the interesting task of predicting (in the aggregate) each of these movements.</blockquote>


This difficulty explains why "many important economic phenomena cannot be explained" (pg 8).

**Formality**

The first chapter of Stigler is clearly informal. As I have copied in my summary, Stigler uses vague terms "more or less", "better", or "rational" without formally defining these in a way that more modern textbooks would require. Yet Stigler stresses logical precision and empirical evidence when developing a theory. Throughout the rest of the book, Stigler insists he will follow all the rigor required of a modern (1987) textbook. Stigler sees this as a mixed blessing, but admits formality and precision advances the economic science.


## Analysis


Stigler starts out with a "big picture" introduction to economics which is refreshing. There is no questions about the goals of price theory (prediction) and his general approach to developing theory. Stigler stresses logic _and_ empirical evidence throughout the first chapter. Stigler immediately notifies readers of the goal of economics, prediction. Many Austrians would argue that true theory is separate from history or prediction. For Austrians, theory is about developing a logically coherent explanation of human action. If the logic is true, those predictions which are possible will follow. Although, Austrians are extremely wary of [prediction](http://www.economicthought.net/blog/?p=2561). For a fun look at this difference in method, see [this debate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RByG_vutE) between Robert Murphy and David Friedman.

While the introduction might seem rather soft in the world of MWG, This is not true. True, Stigler attempts to engage the reader. All reading is a conversation and Stigler is a lot more fun to talk with than other writers. Engagement is important, no matter what "scientists" say (See [McCloskey](http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/interviews/australia.php)). Conversation is not the opposite of rigor. Those who dismiss any textbooks besides Mas-Colell should have a quick glance through Stigler. It just might dismantle some prior ideas as it did with me. Besides being a key role in the training of two generations, Stigler shows that rigor can exist outside of a quasi-real analysis course.
