The following comes from page 54 of _[New Directions in Austrian Economics](https://mises.org/books/newdirections.pdf)._ It's an essay by Mario Rizzo called "Praxeology and Econometrics."


<blockquote>We do not have a choice as to whether we shall make methodological decisions. Our choice, rather, is whether we shall make them explicitly, examining the various implications and subtleties of meaning, or whether we shall make them implicitly, blind to everything but technique.</blockquote>


We can ignore the questions about what it means to do economics. That doesn't mean the questions and problems go away. This is our science and we should know what we are doing as scientists. We can be more clear (at least to ourselves) about what good economics involves.
