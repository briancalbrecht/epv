Most economic writing hurts. The English, my goodness, is painful. It doesn't take [Deirdre McCloskey](http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/MCRDC/Economical%20Writing.pdf) to realize this. The following quote shows my point.

Relatively, this isn't that bad. But its competition isn't fierce.


<blockquote>For example, few writers on economic methodology recognize that the activities of formulating economic models and investigating their implications are a sort of conceptual exploration. Instead, most mistakenly regard these activities as offering empirical hypotheses and assess them in terms of some philosophical model of confirmation or falsification.</blockquote>


This doozy comes from a [JEL article](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/ctahr/aheed/Carl/supplementary%20readings/Hausman_1989_Economic_Methodology_in_a_Nutshell.pdf) by Daniel Hausman. I recommend the article. He got the ideas right, once I understood him.

To be fair Hausman writes on philosophy. It's a rule: philosophy cannot be comprehensible to us simpletons. Nevertheless, economics and philosophy are better advanced through writing well.

It doesn't take much.<!-- more -->


## Classic trick #1- remove half the words.




<blockquote><del>For example</del>, few writers <del>on economic methodology</del> recognize that <del>the activities of formulating</del> economic models and <del>investigating their implications </del>are a <del>sort of</del> conceptual exploration. Instead, most mistakenly regard these activities as offering empirical hypotheses and assess them in terms <del>of some philosophical model of confirmation or</del> falsification.</blockquote>


This turns into:


<blockquote>Few writers recognize that economic models are a conceptual exploration. Instead, most mistakenly regard this activity as offering empirical hypotheses and assess them in terms of falsification.</blockquote>


Have we lost the meaning? I don't believe so. If I did lose something, what?

Classic trick #1 turns gobbledygook into English. A good writer, not me, could take it much further. My quick rewrite would be:


<blockquote>Few writers understand that economic models are conceptual tools. Instead, most falsely think of models as right or wrong, subject to The Data.</blockquote>


That still isn't great. None of my writing is. I don't mean to disparage Prof. Hausman, but what reader has time to parse through 12 pages of  gobbledygook? Time is scarce.

Simple editing will help our arguments. We will better advance knowledge.
