From the enlightening book, [_Living Economics _](http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=98)by [Peter Boettke](http://www.coordinationproblem.org/)-


<blockquote>"In the end, then, the New Keynesians are as ideological as the Chicago school. In the hands of both, economics is reduced to a game in which preconceived notions about the goodness or badness of markets are decked out in spectacular theory. In neither case do economists fulfill the fundamental scientific responsibility of testing the veracity of their explanations."</blockquote>
