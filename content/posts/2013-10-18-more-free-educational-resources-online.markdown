David Friedman, one of my [favorite writers](http://econpointofview.com/2013/10/04/how-i-learned-the-little-economics-i-know/), has put his lectures online throughÂ his blog.

I have spent my Friday night listening to his first lecture on the Economic Analysis of Law from [2012](http://ammsweb.scu.edu/webcasts/Bannan237/20120813-102502-Bannan237/main.htm?type=ms&bandwidth=high&audioonly=no&archived=visible&layout=default&trackingInterval=6&time=0&mqa=0&trackingID=153597&trackingUrl=http%3a%2f%2faccordentlaw.scu.edu%2ftrackingPostBack.aspx&u=166&i=3122912&mediaUrl=http://accordentlaw.scu.edu/153597/Playlist.ashx). It is interesting and I plan to listen to the audio version on my daily commute. Here are some other courses that Prof. Friedman has put online for our pleasure-



	
  * Intellectual Property Theory

	
  * Legal Systems Very Different From Ours

	
  * Economic Analysis of Law

	
  * Legal Issues of the 21st Century

	
  * Analytical Methods for Lawyers

	
  * Computers, Crime and Privacy


I urge everyone to check these out. Maybe your commute will be more educational for a few weeks.

How am I supposed to do my problem sets with these online?
