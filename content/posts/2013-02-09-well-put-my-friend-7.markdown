From page 223 of the [LvMI](http://Mises.org) Scholar's Edition of_ [Human Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Action)_-


<blockquote>The pretentious solemnity which statisticians and statistical bureaus display in computing indexes of purchasing power and cost of living is out of place. These [index numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_%28economics%29) are at best rather crude and inaccurate illustrations of changes which have occurred. In periods of slow alterations in relation between the supply of and the demand for money they do not convey any information at all. In periods of inflation and consequently of sharp price changes they provide a rough image of event which every individual experiences in his daily life. A judicious housewife knows much more about price changes as far as they affect her own household than the statistical averages can tell. She has little use for computations disregarding changes both in quality and in the amount of goods which she is able or permitted to buy at the prices entering into the computations.</blockquote>
