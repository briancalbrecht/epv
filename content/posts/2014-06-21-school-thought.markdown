Labels aren't always helpful in academic discourse. When they serve as short-hand, they help. If I say I am an Austrian, I can convey a lot of information in one word. Not all the information is right, but it takes time an energy to explain a full set of views.

When labels dismiss others, they hurt. People too easily dismiss those crazy X economists.

Still. This is a cool chart.

It picks which school of thought you belong to. It doesn't help me understand my own views; I don't need a chart for myself.

However, it puts the schools into perspective with a glance. There are multiple diverse approaches to economics. That's a good thing. (Click to expand.)

(Update: I did not create this chart, but found it from John Aziz.)

Sometimes I take approaches to econ for granted. Not everyone sees economics as exchange. To me that's weird. It's good to be reminded that not everyone believes this. Besides the differences, there is plenty of overlap and possible work between the schools.

Also, while I consider myself a reader of diverse economics, this picture also reminds me that I have neglected some (possibly) good economics from behavioralists and developmentalists. I'll take a look after finals...

In case you are wondering, I guess am a Neoclassical-Austrian-Institutionalists. It's not too surprising, since my banner is Austrian and Chicago-school economists. Readers can guess which title comes from which row.


## What kind of economist are you?
