<blockquote>[![English: Close-up photo of Murray Rothbard](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/RothbardCloseCrop.jpg)](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RothbardCloseCrop.jpg)

"It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a 'dismal science.' But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance."</blockquote>


-[Murray Rothbard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard), [_Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature_](http://www.amazon.com/Egalitarianism-Revolt-Against-Nature-Essays/dp/0945466234/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345518263&sr=8-1&keywords=egalitarianism+as+revolt)
