<blockquote>[![Henry Hazlitt](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Henry_hazlitt.jpg)](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Henry_hazlitt.jpg)

"'The Distribution of Income'... implies to many people that income is first produced, and** then **'distributed'- according to some arbitrary and probably unjust arrangement."- [Henry Hazlitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hazlitt)</blockquote>


"Distribution of Income" is one term I would rename, if I could, to something less confusing. I hope people point out when I use such inappropriate language. Income, which is derived from value, is created, not distributed by anyone in a free society.
