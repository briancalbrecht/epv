As a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, I am exposed to many aspects on economic theory: trade, IO, game theory. However, the ideas that inspired me to become an economist, ideas from people like Mises and Buchanan, are not taught. The Adam Smith Fellowship will allow me to pursue the ideas of these writers in a way that is not possible outside of GMU. Yes, I can read Mises and chat online, but nothing compares with real serious discussions with other academics.





In my coursework, it is too easy to forget there are other lenses for seeing the world than the standard neoclassical economic approach. It is easy for me, even though I have Mises' "Human Action" and Hayek's "Law, Legislation, and Liberty" on my desk. I can't imagine how easy it is for other students to ignore other approaches. I'm stuck thinking about problems through equations about constrained maximization. Each time I've been out to GMU, I have returned with a new vigor and lens to see the world. I break out of the monolithic viewpoint that is academic economics. That keeps me motivated. More importantly for me as an academic, the experiences as an Adam Smith Fellow have inspired me to keep working hard and stay at this academic game.





Thinking deeply about the readings from this year and discussing them with serious students from a variety of fields has influenced my research and my teaching. For example, after the Austrian weekend, I returned to my teaching and was careful to stress the knowledge in an economy. As economists, we often assume that knowledge is given to some benevolent planner. I made clear this is an assumption to make the problem easier. The real world is much trickier. For example, it is impossible for a government to know how much an externality is imposed. Yet, most economics textbooks assume the government can exactly calculate the externality. I stressed heavily this assumption and how big it really is. Hayek and Mises were encouraging me on this point. Spending time at GMU has given me the confidence to make these points, even if most Econ 101 instructors are not. Why not "dare to be different" in our teaching too?
